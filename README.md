# my-first-project
My first GithHub project is a Cheatsheet for HTML Table References
Not sure what to write her, this project is part of my "Front-End-Engineer" career path course on codecademy.
I am uploading it to track my progress, so far I have foundational knowledge of HTML & CSS and showcased a bit of it in this project. 
Lets see how things go as I progress and practice more.

Wish me luck.
